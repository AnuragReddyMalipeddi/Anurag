I will be working with a dataset on the employment outcomes of college graduates 
between 2010 and 2012. The American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates results, 
published the original data on work outcomes. The dataset was cleaned and published on Github by FiveThirtyEight.

Each row in the dataset represents a different college major and includes data on gender diversity, job rates, 
median salaries, and other factors. Here are some of the dataset's columns:

Rank - Sort the results by median earnings (the dataset is ordered by this column).
Major code - This is the main code.
Major - This is the most important part of the explanation.
Major category - The major's category.
Total - This is the total number of people who have a major.
full time sample size - full-time sample size (unweighted).
Graduates who are men.
Women - Women who have earned a bachelor's degree.
Women - Women as a percentage of the overall population.
Employed - The number of people who are employed.
Full-time, year-round employees earn the median wage.
Low wage jobs - The number of people working in low-wage service jobs.
Full-time employees are those who work 35 hours or more a week.
Part-time workers are those who work fewer than 35 hours a week.

Investigate questions from the dataset using visualisations, such as:

Is it true that students with more famous majors earn more money?
The use of scatter plots
How many of the majors are dominated by men? Is it primarily female?
The use of histograms
Which major has the largest number of students?
Using bar graphs
