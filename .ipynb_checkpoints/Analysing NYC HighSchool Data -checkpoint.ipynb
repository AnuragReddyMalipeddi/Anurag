    "# Finding the Relation Between SAT Scores and Demographics in NYC\n",
    "\n",
    "- In USA, efficacy of standardized tests is always controversial in the sense that it is biased towards a certain group. We want to find out to what extent it is the case? The goal of this project is to analyse relationship between SAT scores and race,gender,income and other attributes related to students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SAT is taken by high school students and hence our focus will be on high schools. NYC is made of five boroughs and many districts. Aggregating data district wise will allow us to look at district by district differences. Each school is identified by district borough number(DBN). Many interrelated datasets need to be cleaned and combined into one dataset. Further various demographic factors like sex, colour, race will be analysed to get a better understanding about their relationship with sat results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upon analysing, we found that natives (white people) tend to have upper hand in the exam which is self explanatory. Surprisingly schools with high total enrollment found positive correlation with sat scores. Even though the reason is not clear, females performed better than the males. Safety of student-teachers is of paramount importance when it comes to good sat scores. \n",
