# Geocoding and Analyzing San Francisco Building Permit Data

## OpenStreetMap + R + Tableau = Hassle Free Geocoding, All the power of R + Tableau BI Tools

This project is about exploring and analyzing more than seven years of the City of San Francisco's building permit data and use OpenStreetMap to find the 
geo coordinates of buildings. After creating a new clean dataset that includes geo coordinates, you will use Tableau to visualize and analyze the dataset. 

This project includes basic analytics techniques to open source data, utilize OpenStreetMap API to find geo coordinates of building addresses, 
and finally, to analyze it all together in Tableau to generate additional insights.
