I act as a data analyst for a company that creates Android and 
iOS mobile applications for this project. Our applications can be found on Google Play and the App Store.

We only create applications that are free to download and install, and in-app advertisements 
are our primary source of revenue. This ensures that the number of people who use our app determines
 the majority of our sales. â€” The more people who see the advertisements and interact with them, the better. 
The aim of this project is to evaluate data in order to assist our developers in determining which types of apps
 are most likely to attract new users.
