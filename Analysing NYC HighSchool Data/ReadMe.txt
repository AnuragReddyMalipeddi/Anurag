The validity of standardised exams, and whether they are unfair to some classes, is one of the most 
contentious topics in the US educational system. Investigating the correlations between SAT scores 
and demographics, given our prior knowledge of the topic, may be an interesting angle to take. 
We could link SAT scores to race, gender, income, and other factors.

The Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, is a test that high school students in the United States 
take before applying to colleges. Test scores are taken into account by colleges when determining who to admit, so doing well on it is crucial.

The test is divided into three parts, each with 800 points available. The total score is out of a possible 2,400 points 
(while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). 
High schools are often ranked based on their average SAT ratings. The results are also used to assess the overall standard of the school system.

Few things to know:

The SAT is only taken by high school students, so we'll concentrate on high schools.
New York City is divided into five boroughs, each of which is effectively a separate territory.
Schools in New York City are divided into multiple districts, each of which may have hundreds of schools.
Several different types of schools are represented in our data sets. We'll have to clean them up so we can concentrate solely on high schools.
A DBN, or district borough number, is assigned to each school in New York City.
We may use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district disparities if we aggregate data by district.
